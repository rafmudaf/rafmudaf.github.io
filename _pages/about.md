My professional interests are in applying high performance computing and
software engineering principles to ideas that can change the world. In
particular, I'm interested in using and improving tools for dynamic
analysis of wind energy systems. In my current role as a researcher at
NREL's National Wind Technology Center, I'm
hoping to elevate the state of the art in wind energy simulation
software with a particular focus on software quality and sustainability.

Additionally, I'm interested in how technology can be used to complement
human productivity rather than replace it. A long term objective is to
bring processes and ideas from the Design industry
to scientific computing, and I think software engineers can do
for the virtual world what architects do for the physical world.

In summary of me: I’m hopeful that responsible, ethical science can solve
some of the problems that policy cannot; I’m thankful to be able to
spend some time outside every day; and I know that the future is bright!
