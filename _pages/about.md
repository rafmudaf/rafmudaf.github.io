My professional interests are in applying high performance computing and
software engineering principles to ideas that can change the world. In
particular, I'm interested in using and improving tools for dynamic
analysis of wind energy systems. In my current role as a researcher at
NREL's National Wind Technology Center, I'm
hoping to elevate the state of the art in wind energy simulation
software with a particular focus on software quality and sustainability.

In addition to reducing humanity's carbon footprint by enabling the
development of more efficient wind turbines and wind farms, I'm interested
in how technology can be incorporated into our daily lives to complement
human productivity rather than replace it. A long term objective is to
bring processes and ideas from the Design industry
to scientific computing, and I think software engineers can do
for the virtual world what architects do for the physical world.
Further, I'm interested in the coupling
of next generation technologies in math and computer science (i.e. AI/ML)
into applications for clean energy and social good.

In summary of me: I’m hopeful that responsible, ethical tech can solve
all the problems that politics cannot; I’m thankful to be able to
spend some time outside every day; and I know that the future is bright
despite all odds.
