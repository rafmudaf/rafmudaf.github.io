My professional interests are in using computers to solve difficult problems
in engineering and specifically renewable energy.
In my current role as a Researcher at NREL's National Wind Technology Center,
I'm hoping to elevate the state of the art in wind energy simulation software
with a particular focus on software quality, usability, and sustainability.
