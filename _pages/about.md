My professional interests are in applying high performance computing and
software engineering principles to ideas that can change the world. In
particular, I’m interested in using and improving tools for aerodynamic
analysis of turbomachinery. Combining a background in aerospace
engineering, computational fluid dynamics, and software engineering,
I’m able to do exactly that as a wind turbine modeling software engineer
at the National Wind Technology Center of the National Renewable Energy
Lab.

In addition to reducing humanity’s carbon footprint by enabling the
design of more efficient wind turbines, I am interested in how technology
can be incorporated into our daily lives to complement human productivity
rather than replace it. I enjoy writing apps for image processing, audio
processing, and computation, and a long term objective is to bring the
highly efficient and sustainable practices of app development to scientific
computing. Even further, I would like to see scientific simulation in
everyday life by, for example, generalizing something like SETI@home to
take advantage of the hardware in our pockets to make a massively
parallel compute cluster at social hubs like breweries or gyms.

In summary of me: I’m hopeful that responsible, ethical tech can solve
all the problems that politics cannot; I’m thankful to be able to
spend some time outside every day; and I know that the future is bright
despite all odds.
