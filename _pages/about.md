My professional interests are in applying high performance computing and
software engineering principles to ideas that can change the world. In
particular, I'm interested in using and improving tools for aerodynamic
analysis of turbomachinery. In my current role as a researcher at
NREL's National Wind Technology Center, I'm leveraging experience in
aerospace engineering, computational fluid dynamics, and software
engineering to elevate the state of the art in wind energy simulation
software with a particular focus on software quality and sustainability.

In addition to reducing humanity's carbon footprint by enabling the
design of more efficient wind turbines and wind farms, I'm interested
in how technology can be incorporated into our daily lives to complement
human productivity rather than replace it. I enjoy creating iPhone apps
for image processing, audio processing, and computation, and a long term
objective is to bring the efficient and sustainable practices of the tech
industry to scientific computing. Further, I'm interested in the coupling
of next generation technologies in math and computer science (i.e. AI/ML)
into applications for clean energy and social good.

In summary of me: I’m hopeful that responsible, ethical tech can solve
all the problems that politics cannot; I’m thankful to be able to
spend some time outside every day; and I know that the future is bright
despite all odds.
