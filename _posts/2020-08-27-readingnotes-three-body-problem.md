This is a pretty excellent book by Liu Cixin. Packed with casual physics
and math plus scifi and plenty of social commentary.

I didn't take notes for this one but these two lines really stood out.

*It was impossible to expect a moral awakening from humankind itself,
just like it was impossible to expect humans to lift off the earth
by pulling up on their own hair. To achieve moral awakening required
a force outside the human race.*

*Prosecutorial organs would rather be too severe than too lax. This is
because treating you too severely would just be a mistake in method,
but treating you too laxly would be a mistake in political direction.*
