This paper by John von Neumann, published in 1955, gives his thoughts on
how humanity has and will continue to interact with itself amidst a
continuously changing technology landscape. You can get the paper
with my highlights
<a href="/media/reading/vonneumann_survive_technology.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

I've copied some excerpts that I found interesting and put down some
of my own thoughts below that. This is mostly for my own reference,
so it may not make much sense without reading the paper.

## Excerpts

*environment ... undersized and underorganized*

*In all its stages the industrial revolution consisted of
making available more and cheaper energy, more and
easier controls of human actions and reactions, and more
and faster communications. Each development increased
the effectiveness of the other two*

*But throughout the development, increased speed did not
so much shorten time requirements of processes as extend
the areas of the earth affected by them. The reason is clear.
Since most time scales are fixed by
human reaction times, habits, and other physiological and
psychological factors, the effect of the increased speed of
technological processes was to enlarge the size of
units - political, organizational, economic, and cultural -
affected by technological operations. That is, instead of
performing the same operations as before in less time,
now larger-scale operations were performed in the same
time. This important evolution has a natural limit, that
of the earth's actual size.*

*Consequently, a few decades hence energy may be free - just
like the unmetered air - with coal and oil used mainly
as raw materials for organic chemical synthesis, to
which, as experience has shown, their properties are
best suited*

*Nature has, of course, been operating
nuclear processes all along, well and massively, but
her "natural" sites for this industry are entire stars.
There is reason to believe that the minimum space requirements
for her way of operating are the minimum sizes of stars.*

*Also likely to evolve fast - and quite apart from nuclear evolution
is automation.*

*The last decade or two has also witnessed an increasing ability to control
and "discipline" large numbers of such devices within
one machine. Many such machines have been built to perform
complicated scientific and engineering calculations and large
scale accounting and logistical surveys.*

*Fundamentally, improvements in control are really
improvements in communicating information within an
organization or mechanism.*

*The carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere by
industry's burning of coal and oil - more than half of it
during the last generation - may have changed the atmosphere's
composition sufficiently to account for a general warming of
the world by about one degree Fahrenheit.*

*What could be done, of course, is no index to what
should be done; to make a new ice age in order to annoy
others, or a new tropical, "interglacial" age in order to
please everybody, is not necessarily a rational program.*

*All this will merge each nation's
affairs with those of every other, more thoroughly
than the threat of a nuclear or any other war may
already have done.*

*the very techniques that create the dangers
and the instabilities are in themselves useful, or closely
related to the useful.*

*Technological power, technological efficiency as such, is an ambivalent
achievement. Its danger is intrinsic.*

*Hence the banning of particular technologies
would have to be enforced on a worldwide basis. But the
only authority that could do this effectively would have
to be of such scope and perfection as to signal the resolution
of international problems rather than the discovery
of a means to resolve them.*

*Specifically, the effects that we are now beginning to
produce are of the same order of magnitude as that of
"the great globe itself."*

> flexibility, intelligence.

## What I think about it

I found this paper interesting in a few different ways. First,
its always neat to get a clear insight into the thoughts and emotions
of previous generations. Some things change, but others stay exactly
the same. More profoundly, though, understanding the context in which
this paper was written makes reading it 65 years later kind of terrifying.

The opening idea hit hard: humanity has outgrown the spacial scale of
the Earth. Technological progress in the modern world
happens on a time and space scale (maybe on a data scale?) much larger
than it did 100 years ago and very different than natural changes on Earth.
This has become a **limitation** on **an essential safety factor**.
**We are running out of room**. One consequence is that we don't
do the same things faster now that we have computers and technology.
Instead, we do the same things in a much larger scale and scope.
This seems contrary to the promise of technology that we'll get more
time to ourselves and accomplish all of our tasks in less time since
we are, in theory, more efficient.

> The intrinsic scales are important.

Another point made is that automated controls will redefine industry
and all of our daily life. I think that prediction has come true and
we are at the point where large scale control is expected in areas that
may not truly need it. It's so ubiquitous that we expect it in truly silly
things like counter top appliances and toys.

Finally, there is some attention to climate change and climate control.
Although von Neumann didn't focus too much on the social impacts of climate
change, I thought it was interesting that it was a generally known issue among
scientists in the 1950's. So much so that it is casually mentioned in this
paper without any reference or explanation. The larger point is that the
climate is malleable, and with that realization comes the idea of climate
control. this technology could be used for nefarious purposes
resulting in unintended or difficult to predict consequences.
Given the current state of the world dealing with the COVID pandemic,
it's interesting to realize that we are so much more tightly coupled
than in the past. Assuming COVID is not actually man-made, its especially
concerning to consider what kind of impact biological warfare could have
in today's world. For example, if a group or country has a virus and its
vaccine, we now know that its spread can happen effectively and organically
while also stirring up political and social turmoil in some of the most
powerful economies.

In the end, the most powerful idea in the paper is the reality that our
impact has grown beyond that of the Earth and nature, and that scale at
which we operate with a given technology is extremely important. Truly, it
can impact the globe. So, while technology has given humanity the power to
destroy itself, its up to humanity itself to maintain the patience,
flexibility, and intelligence to prevent our own demise and keep the dream
alive.
