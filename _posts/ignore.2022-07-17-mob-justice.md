I woke up on Wednesday, June 15, feeling happy about the day. I remember it specifically because
Katie had COVID the week before so she was working from home this week, and I love it when we both
work from home. Around noon, a friend sent us a text message about a Zillow listing that we had
posted the day before being on the "Bad Landlords Nola" Facebook group.

<img src="/images/posts/mob_justice/badlandlord_headsup.jpg" width="300" />

My first thought was that it was not important at all and everyone would realize that it was taken
out of context. After all, we weren't even landlords yet. A couple of hours later, we were told
about a similar post on Instagram. And then a few hours after that, my neighbor sent me the reddit
thread. My personal website, which has no real content and gets very little web traffic, had about
50 visitors in an hour, and I started to get emails through a contact form on the site.

<img src="/images/posts/mob_justice/traffic.png" width="300" />

I don't engage much on the internet or social media, so I had no idea about the type of comments
and behaviors on the New Orleans corners of the internet. Pretty soon, I was deep into reading
these comments and taking things very personally. A few people suggested vandalizing the Airstream,
so we blocked off a transparant portion of the fence with a tarp, and I stayed up most of the night
checking the security cameras and dwelling on what was happening. In those first few hours, I
thought that all of New Orleans must have seen these posts. It was extremely embarassing. Since
the beginning of the year, I had been intentionally going out of my way to expand my social circle
and make new friends. I've been more talkative to people in public, I try to remember names and
say hi to people when I see them, and I've been playing a ton of soccer in an effort to connect
with new people in ways that have worked well in the past. In these few hours, I was replaying
so many great interactions I've had with new people that would now be tainted by this. It was
terrible.

Fortunately for us, we have invested in building a family here in New Orleans. Some key people
brought us out of our own heads and into the reality that the internet is full of hate, and the
thruth about our decision to rent the Airstream is not even close to the response we were getting.
Even a small text message from a soccer teammate inviting me to a pickup game meant the world in
that moment.

<img src="/images/posts/mob_justice/soccer.jpg" width="300" />

I'm writing about this here primarily to get it off my chest and out of my head. I also want to
make it clear that the consequence of this mob mentality and mob justice is real. Cyber bullying
has real impacts in the world on real human beings.

## The Zillow post

The Zillow post was for renting out our Airstream for $950 per month. It described the Airstream
in somewhat romanticized language and stated that the person would have to clean the pool and
maintain the garden. It was a silly post, for sure, but it was not aggregious. There were photos
of the Airstream itself as well as the yard and space around it.

The decision to list the Airstream for rent on Zillow was in response to some things that had
recently happened. First, there's some context to understand. We moved into the Airstream
full-time at the beginning of 2020. Doing so helped us save a lot of money since we were not
paying rent, our utilities were very low, and we could not buy much of anything since there was
nowhere to put it. Even though we weren't quite ready to leave the Airstream, we ended up buying
a house in May 2021 because a friend of ours was selling hers a block away. We loved her house
and thought it would be great for us when the time came for a bigger space. The idea was that we
would rent it for the first couple of years. Then, in August 2021, Hurricane Ida hit New Orleans
and took about a quarter of the roof off of the house. The tenants moved out, and since it was
not rentable we left the Airstream and moved into the house. In order to generate some income
from the Airstream, we listed it on Airbnb and had a lot of success - we even made it to
"super host" status.

Airbnb was never meant to be a long term situation. It turned out to be more work than we
wanted to put in, and neither of us like the idea of contributing to tourists in a residential
neighborhood or taking up a great living situation with a short term, out of town tenant. We had
just wrapped up a stretch of Airbnb guests and were looking to do something more long term with
the Airstream. On top of this, we had just scored a great tenant for the other half of out house
by listing it on Zillow a few days earlier. The decision to post the Airstream on Zillow was a
very quick decision and we copied almost everything directly from the Airbnb listing.
The price was a guess based on the other rentals in the area. We didn't want to be the cheapest
option because we wanted to attract people who wanted to specifically live in a tiny house or
Airstream. Since it's fully furnished and ready to live in, we thought a travelling professional
like a nurse or film crew would be ideal. Another thought was that moving to New Orleans can be
difficult since you have to lock in a rental very quickly and then immediately start furnishing
it. Our Airstream would have provided an option for someone in transition from one place to
another to live light-weight for a few months while they figured out something more long term.
This space requires a lot of hands on maintenance, and we wanted to be sure to fill it with
someone who wanted to be there and would take care it.

For what its worth, we got about 10 responses to the post in the first day and even showed the
Airstream to a prospective tenant.

## The response

I'm not going to link to the places where this was posted, but you can find it, if you really want.
The gist of it is that people were quite offended by the idea of renting an Airstream for nearly
$1000 per month and having the audacity to require the tenant to clean the pool, maintain the
yard, and empty the composting toilet. There were some comments about us bringing back serfdom,
preying on people, and exploiting the neighborhood. Many people suggested I "fuck off" in a
variety of ways. The last section of this post has some jucier details.

My name and some personal information was quickly added to the threads, and people noticed that
the electrical connection uses a temporary pole. A few people noted the various ways in which
this setup is in violation of the code, and I verified that it was reported to the city through 311.

## Why this hit so deep

I very much wish I could write off this whole episode as the overreaction of an angry internet
mob with nothing better to do than criticize the world around it. Unfortunately, I can't unread
these comments. There are a few things in particular that were said that really struck a chord,
and the consequences of all of this attention are extremely unfortunate for the very same
community of people that the mob thinks its protecting. As it turns out, this is the community
of people in which I live my every day life in St Roch, so I get to see the consequences play
out in real time while the reddit and Instragram crowd hang out behind their computers.

### The personal angle

Since property records are publicly available through the New Orleans Assessor's site, my name was
pretty quickly revealed. I've intentionally tried to keep my information off of the internet most
of my life, and I think this general lack of information about me caused these people to construct
an image of me that fed into their storyline about outsiders abusing *them*, the real, righteous
New Orleans. Somehow I was morphed into a "tech bro" that "cannot be saved" and "should be hung".
This stung because my job has very little in common with the tech industry. I work at a Department
of Energy National Lab as a researcher in wind energy, and a part of that is developing open
source software that is freely available to anyone on the planet. My working life has been
driven by a desire to contribute to humanity in a positive and productive way. I've found that
in wind energy, and this is a big part of my identity and my day to day life.

Many of the comments suggest that the Airstream is somehow a bad or predatory place to live.
On the contrary, its a wonderful place! The motivation for us to build out an Airstream six
years ago was - surprise - the high cost of rent and housing prices in New Orleans. At that time,
we were not on a trajectory to purchase a house in the foreseeable future. We sat outside of
Markey's one Friday night scheming for other living options and perusing Craigslist for vans etc
when we saw an Airstream and realized that this could give us the opportunity to stop paying rent
and start saving while also living in a space that we design and want to be in. We spent literally
all of our money to buy the Airstream and the lot. The three years when we were working on the
Airstream were incredibly challenging due to lack of money and uncertainty over where this
project would go. When we finally moved in full time in 2020, we were absolutely overjoyed.
It was a very different lifestyle, but we settled in quick. By the Spring of 2021, we had added
a cat to the mix and Airstream living was much more fun than work. That space, inside and out,
is truly a part of our soul.

We didn't know it when we bought the land, but we landed in a very special community of people
in St Roch. This neighborhood has become a major point of pride for me: Saint Roch, New Orleans.
The comments about my exploiting the neighborhood really hit hard. I respect this neighborhood
and the people in it, and I truly hope I'm making things better for the people around me.
I've been on the board of the Faubourg St Roch Improvement Association for nearly two years,
spent countless hours hastling Code Enforcement to do something about the negligent property
owners in our area who let their properties decay into vagrancy and blight, helped to organize
a monthly clean up going on two years, hauled trash to the dump after Ida when the city wasn't
doing it, and tried to serve my community in many other ways. This is my neighborhood.
I cannot walk from my house to St Claude without saying hello to multiple people and probably
getting into a quick conversation about Hushpuppy's grumpy face or the Saints or the rain or
the heat or whatever else. However, I know that the path to evil is paved with good intentions,
and the comments lobbed at me regarding my impact on St Roch have really shaken my sense of
place in this community.

### The impact on Housing in St Roch

The Airstream situation was certainly illegal. It is not allowed to have a trailer connected to
city utilities and ours was connected to the electricity. Since a 311 complaint has been filed
to Safety and Permits, I expect that our electrical connection will soon be removed. This means
that a viable living situation, one in which two people, a dog, and cat lived very well for two
years, will no longer be available as a living space. The reason the internet mob cited for taking
it away as an option for renters is that the price of rent is too high in New Orleans. There are a
finite amount of living spaces available for rent in New Orleans and much more demand than space
to fill it. This internet mob has now reduced the amount of living spaces by one, but they have
not reduced the demand. This simple contradiction is driving me absolutely crazy!

It has essentially been my part time job for over two years to compel Code Enforcement to compel
absent property owners to take responsibility over their vacant and blighted properties.
According to [The Data Center](https://www.datacenterresearch.org/data-resources/neighborhood-data/district-7/St-Roch/),
27% of the St Roch neighborhood residential buildings were vacant between 2015 and 2019.
That is nearly one in three! A particular set of properties near us (1400-1402 Music St,
1404-1406 Music St, 2425 N Villere St) is owned by one man and has been vacant for over 10 years.
These are five addresses that could each house a full family. Considering an occupancy of 2 people
each, this is 100 human years of vacancy! In my opinion, this has a much more significant impact
on the price of rent and the fabric of our neighborhood than anything I or anyone else around
Music and Villere have ever done in our entire lives.

While I completely understand the sentiment that $950 for a trailer is outrageous, the response
to our listing ignores the fact that this was the least expensive and highest quality option for
a private space in our side of town. It disregards that this is a fully furnished living space
and the lease was month-to-month and highly flexible. We felt that we were filling a gap. At
the very least, I lament that we aren't able to take the feedback and correct our actions. If we
posted it for $800, would that be more reasonable? $600? Either of these options would have been
doable for us with the right tenant, but that option was taken away by the internet mob since
the longevity of our electrical connection is in question. This is a shame for St Roch and New
Orleans.

## Where we go from here

The world seems to be changing faster and faster, and I think I haven't kept up with it. Through
this experience, I know I for one have changed quite a bit, and I'm still chewing on it.
Most directly, I've been reevaluating my relationship with everyone around me.

![](/images/posts/mob_justice/streetwisdom.jpg)

Ultimately, I hope that anyone reading this understands that words have weight. In today's world,
a view, follow, up-vote, or like has weight. It indicates support and contributes to virality.
When enough people support something, its easy to jump on the momentum and then suddenly there's
a bunch of sheep following a shapeless leader made up of a mix of emotions. The problem is that
every person on the other end of an internet mob is... A PERSON. They have whole lives that
can't be understood or summarized in a post. There's a line in the final episode of the show
The Newsroom that has stuck with me for years:
[Why is overrated more fun than, say, underrated?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIwA6I7xUxg)
If we have a choice to elevate something through our action on the internet, why not elevate love?
Why is it so much more fun to tear down rather than build up? As a society, I think we really
can and should do better.

As for the Airstream, we will likely sell it in the Fall. It will be nearly impossible to
maintain it if the electricity is disconnected, and we have no intention of owning an empty
living space. This is a beautiful home for someone who values it, and it should be used as one.
For us, it was a wonderful journey and we grew into ourselves throughout the process. It is a
bitter end, but with time I hope we remember and focus on the sweetness that came out of living
in a small space and making it ours.

# Dropping the veil

One of the most frustrating parts of this is that so many people have chimed in with comments or
direct emails, but exactly 1 person chose to engage in productive dialogue. Everyone else formed
and shared an opinion entirely without our input. Even more maddening is that almost all of the
people who commented on Instagram and reddit have a veil of anonymity. They are slinging hate
and bringing negativity to my world, but do not have to stand by their words. Interestingly,
many of them do not live in New Orleans and, at least on the surface, seem to engage in the
same capitalist exploitation that they're ranting about under the cover of their online
alias. Here are the people I've been able to definitively identify along with their comments or
emails. There are many more comments from people that I haven't tried to find or they've done
a better job of remaining anonymous.


## Bree Gladden
This is the original poster on reddit through [/u/suzeerbedrol](https://www.reddit.com/user/suzeerbedrol/).
Her job is refinishing old furniture and selling it on Magazine St through her company AGM Designs
NOLA. There's plenty of irony in Bree upselling furniture but posting about our remodeled Airstream.

NOLA landlord thinks it's acceptable to charge $950 + utilities for 180sqft airstream off of
St.Claude in their backyard BUT THATS NOT ALL! They also expect you to work on their yard and take
care of their pool!!
A portion of the description reads -
"The airstream has a good amount of storage for clothing, food, and toiletries. However, there is
no space of additional furniture. Kitchenette consists of an apartment size refrigerator, 2 burner
plug in induction cook top, microwave, and countertop oven. There is a full bathroom, heat and air
conditioning, hot water, and fast wifi. It is important to note that it has a composting toilet,
which is easy to use but requires upkeep and isn't for everyone.
We are trying to find the right fit for this very unique space. Renter will be responsible for
taking care of the yard and pool, so an ideal renter would enjoy gardening. Renter will also be
responsible for emptying the composting toilet, which is not a chore that everyone is up for!
However, if the idea of a a more green way of living is appealing to you, then this space could
be a great fit! No smoking in airstream or on property. Pets are evaluated on a case by case basis.
There is plenty of on street parking in front of the property. We would love to find a long term
tenant, but we are willing to rent it out monthly to make sure its a good fit for everyone and to
build some flexibility into the lease. Renter is responsible for paying all utilities
(water, entergy, internet)."

Hey man, I'm not saying anything about these people personally, but I can say with
100% confidence- if they were really "nice & progressive" - key word "PROGRESSIVE", they would
not be trying to capitalize on their spare airstream in the midst of a housing crisis. . I think
this type of living situation can be beneficial, exchange work for quarters is not a new idea.
HOWEVER, you cannot reasonably charge someone almost a grand in rent for 180sqft, while also
expecting them to work?! There is nothing nice and progressive about that. I pay $250 more than
that in rent for a two story townhouse in the LGD, and have to do ZERO yard work? This person
needs a reality check, I don't care.

Lol some poor "quirky" fool with money on a soul search that just LED them to the "spirit" of
NOLA. Probably from L.A or something .

I’m interested in renting out your airstream in the culturally accepted neighborhood of the 9th
ward. Does the $950/mt include a shovel for moving my turds from the toilet deposit to the
heirloom tomato garden? 

Good lord your energy sustainability platform stinks just as much as the mirlintons growing in
your shit garden. 

Good luck, I’m sure some transplant will rent from you for a month after breaking lease bc
his neighbors kids kept on mugging him.

If you're really trying to rent out an airstream for $950 a month and require your tenant to
maintain your lawn and pool then you're ridiculous. What a disgusting, disgraceful person it
takes to attempt to take advantage of someone in such a manner. Shameful.

Go get that money, son. Community means nothing to you.

Hi! 

I saw your add on Zillow and wanted to contact you to let you know that tech bros like you
are ruining our city. And really, ruining our world. The audacity to try and rent out an
airstream for almost 1k AND demand free labor… 

Maybe if you’re actually interested in “tech fixing things politics cannot,” you should try
and help with the housing crisis- not fuel it. 

Please leave this city and please stop being a piece of shit. 

Best, 
The People of New Orleans

I saw your Zillow post for your Airstream. Fucking ridiculous to charge $950 for such a
shitty space and expect your renter to pay for utilities/misc. AND have to take care of your
fucking pool and yard. Not to mention it doesn't even have a real fucking toilet. It's not a
real toilet. No matter how nicely you word it as a green alternative. Shame on you for trying
to take advantage of someone. I wish you the worst. I hope you lose your home and end up living
out of that piece of shit yourself.
