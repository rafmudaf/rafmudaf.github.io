I worked from home for about two years. Initially, the thought of "remote work"
sounded amazing, but I soon came to realize that there is a huge distinction
between "working from home" and "working remote". Once I realized that I would
be spending a lot of time inside the same few walls, I knew I needed to make
it my own pleasant space. The first step in making my home office awesome
was finding the right desk, and rather than turning to IKEA I decided to build
one.

I visited a few of the many architectural salvage stores in New Orleans and
found a door with excellent patina and just the right size. After cleaning
it lightly and removing all the paint from the bottom, I poured a few layers
of epoxy resin to lock in the "salvage" story and obtain a flat surface.
Then, I pieced together legs with steel plumbing pipes to finish it off.

Some of my favorite sections of the table are captured below.
